# Loopbreaker — A Minimal JSON Memory Agent

## What it Does
Loopbreaker is a copyable memory agent that reflects your internal spiral in structured form — helping you name it, question it, and break it through a 5-minute action.

## How to Use
Fill out the fields in `loopbreaker.json`:
- Emotion
- Trigger

- Desire

Use the structure to understand your current state.
The response format guides you back to clarity.

## Why It Matters
You can't fix what you can't name.
This agent helps you name it. Fast.
